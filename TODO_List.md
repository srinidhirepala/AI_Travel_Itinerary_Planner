---

### Phase 2: MVP - Core Itinerary Generation
- [ ] **AI Engine (MVP):**
    - [ ] Research and select a primary Large Language Model (LLM) provider.
    - [ ] Develop initial prompt templates to generate a basic itinerary from `Destination` and `Dates`.
    - [ ] Implement a parser to convert the LLM's text output into a structured JSON object.
- [ ] **API (MVP):**
    - [ ] Create the core API endpoint (`/generate-itinerary`) to handle user requests.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the AI prompt generation and parsing logic.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the `/generate-itinerary` endpoint.

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (MVP)
- [ ] **Framework Setup:**
    - [ ] Initialize a React/Vite (or similar) frontend application.
- [ ] **UI/UX (MVP):**
    - [ ] Build the user input form for destination and dates.
    - [ ] Create a clean, readable view to render the structured itinerary data.
- [ ] **Integration:**
    - [ ] Connect the frontend to the backend user and itinerary APIs.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Set up a frontend testing framework (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library).
    - [ ] Write component tests for the input form and itinerary display.

---

### Phase 4: Feature Expansion - Personalization
- [ ] **Backend:** Extend the user model and database schema to include budget, travel style, interests, etc.
- [ ] **AI Engine:** Refine prompt templates to incorporate the detailed user profile, yielding personalized results.
- [ ] **Frontend:** Build the "User Preferences" page to allow users to set their profile data.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the updated personalization logic in the AI engine.
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the user preferences API endpoints.

---

### Phase 5: Feature Expansion - Real-Time Data Engine
- [ ] **API & Data Integration:**
    - [ ] **Flights:** Integrate a flight data API (e.g., Skyscanner) to fetch real-time schedules and prices.
    - [ ] **Hotels:** Integrate a hotel API (e.g., Booking.com) for availability and pricing.
    - [ ] **Weather:** Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- [ ] **AI Engine:** Develop logic for the AI to use this live data for more accurate, dynamic suggestions.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write integration tests for each third-party API connection to ensure data integrity.

---

### Phase 6: Feature Expansion - Booking, Content & Convenience
- [ ] **Integrated Booking:**
    - [ ] **Backend:** Implement affiliate link generation and tracking.
    - [ ] **Frontend:** Add "Book Now" CTAs to the UI.
- [ ] **Rich Content & Expertise:**
    - [ ] **Backend:** Implement advanced filtering logic and currency conversion.
    - [ ] **AI:** Train/prompt the AI to include "hidden gems" and local tips.
- [ ] **Convenience Features:**
    - [ ] **Backend:** Implement PDF generation for itineraries.
    - [ ] **Frontend:** Add an interactive map view (e.g., Mapbox, Leaflet).
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for currency conversion and filtering logic.
    - [ ] Write E2E tests for the booking and PDF download user flows.

---

### Phase 7: Feature Expansion - Social & Gamification
- [ ] **Social & Collaborative Planning:**
    - [ ] **Backend:** Implement real-time database/WebSocket logic for collaborative editing.
    - [ ] **Frontend:** Build the collaborative UI.
- [ ] **Engagement & Gamification:**
    - [ ] **Backend:** Design and implement the database models and logic for travel journals and achievements.
    - [ ] **Frontend:** Create the UI for the journal and user achievements.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write integration tests for the real-time collaboration features.
    - [ ] Write unit tests for the gamification logic.
