Gemini: feat: Convert project documentation to Markdown

Refactors the project's core documentation files (`description.txt`, `critique.txt`) from plain text to Markdown format (`.md`).

Gemini: docs(logging): Add chat history and prompt review logs

Introduces the `chat_logs/` directory to maintain a record of the interactions used to bootstrap and define the project requirements.

This includes:
- `initial_chat_on_6-09-25.txt`: A log of the conversation history.
- `Chatprompts_review.txt`: A file containing analysis and suggestions for the prompts used during the session.

These logs are configured to be automatically updated after each prompt to provide a continuous record of the development and prompt engineering process.
